    "summary": "I've always been passionate about technology. In Spain, I graduated in a BSc in Computer Science then completed with a 2 years MSc. After a period working in Madrid, I decided to move to the UK in order to improve my English and pursue a career in IT. Each of the professional experiences I had in the UK, have helped me to grow as a professional and as a person: from Fizzback through NICE, where I had not only colleagues but also friends, to my latest experience at Makers Academy. The latter has been a really intense and rewarding experience: at Makers Academy I learnt how to develop the correct mindset and the necessary skills to become a software engineer.",
